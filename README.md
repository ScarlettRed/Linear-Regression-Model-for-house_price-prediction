# Predicting House Prices: A Linear Regression Model
A basic linear regression model which can predict the house prices of a particular area w.r.t. the given dataset, using SFRAMES in Turicreate.
 
# What is Turicreate?
Turicreate is a python library used to deal with big data. It is easy to use and can easily handle and manipulate data as compared to other python libraries. It is easy to use and you don't have to be an expert in Machine Learning to use this library. SFrames are used in turicreate to scale all the data used for model building. Turicreate is very much capable to build custom machine learning models in an easy go. 
# Installing Turicreate
It would be better if you create a virtual environment to run turicreate in jupyter notebook. Let's learn how to create virtualenvironment first.
### Creating virtual Environment
-> sudo apt-get install -y libstdc++6 python-setuptools <break>
-> sudo apt-get install python3-pip 
-> sudo pip3 install virtualenv 
-> virtualenv venv
-> source venv/bin/activate  // This particular command will actiavte your virtual environment "venv".
### Now for installing turicreate:-
-> pip3 install turicreate

# Loading and Analysis of data
